### Exploring various factors that might affect epilepsy and seizure recurrence

#### Milestone 4 - Proposal

Propose methodologies and ideas to be implemented, tested and interpreted for your final project.

#### Milestone 5 - Baselines

• Decide on the performance metric to evaluate prediction.
• Feature extraction: Extract a set of basic features from past data
• Implement the following baseline techniques:
o Linear regression: Train a linear regression model on features extracted from seizure data.
o Logistic regression: Using logistic regression to predict the occurrence of subsequent seizures following the first occurrence.
o Linear discriminant analysis: Using LDA to parse the textual data and categorize factors effecting seizure occurrence into certain groups and with demographics.
