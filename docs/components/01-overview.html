                <h3>What is epilepsy?</h3> Epilepsy is one of the most common neurologic
                conditions in the United States, affecting at least 1 in 100 adults and 1 in
                20 children. There are more than 40 types of epilepsy—referred to collectively
                as the epilepsies—that cause recurrent seizures and that can be responsible
                for brain damage; neurological, cognitive, or psychiatric impairment; and death.
                Advances in research are improving our understanding of the scope of epilepsy a
                nd its public health impact.<br/> However, current approaches often do not fully
                take into account either the broad range of epilepsy disorders or their consequences
                 for health and quality of life.[1] Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in
                 childhood and can have a major impact on a child's development. In many children
                  the seizures remit, but in others the disorder continues and may affect adult life.

                <h3>What are we trying to do?</h3> Our goal is to identify factors which may lead persons
                having seizures to be diagnosed with epilepsy.
                This will help medical personnel treat and prevent seizures at an early age.
                Prompt medication can allow epilepsy patients to be cured of their seizures.
                This lower the burden on caregivers and the cost to society.  
                Several tests to diagnose epilepsy are performed to determine
                the cause of seizures. <br/> These tests may include:

            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <ul class="list-group">
                    <li class="list-group-item">Neurological examination</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">EEG and other brain wave monitoring methods</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Blood tests</li>

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-10">
            <br/> However, the critical factors and threshold for diagnosis based on these tools is not hard-fast.
            As such, exploring various factors that might affect epilepsy and/or seizure recurrence could be useful
             for identifying the disease amongst the general population.<br/>

                <h3>What Data?</h3> The data we evaluated included:

                    <li class="list-group-item">Efficacy results from clinical drug trials</li>

              <h3>Which factors are most important?</h3>
              After evaluating the relevance of all the variables in the data. We found a great
              deal of the predictors were correlated.  This allowed us to discard
              many of the columns.  Subsequent calculations using a series of linear, quadratric,
              nearest-neighbor and tree based models established the following to be
              best across the most solutions:
              <ul class="list-group">
                  <li class="list-group-item">Convulsions or fits leading to unconsciousness</li>
                  <li class="list-group-item">Fit or convulsion in 1st year of life</li>
                  <li class="list-group-item">Abnormal heart</li>
                  <li class="list-group-item">Central nervous system condition</li>
                  <li class="list-group-item">Heart murmur</li>
              </ul>
              We suspect that these can be evaluated by health care professionals
              in areas where basic medical technology levels are available.  This
              extends the usefulness of our model beyond the "First World."

                <h3>Conclusion</h3> By the age of 11 years 1043 children (6-7%) in an unselected national sample had a history of seizures or other episodes of loss of consciousness; 322 (20 8/1000) had a history offebrile convulsions without other epileptic problems. A
                clear-cut diagnosis of non-febrile epilepsy was established in 64 children (41/1000) by the age of 11 on the basis of confirmatory information supplied by family doctors and paediatricians. A further 39 (2-6/1000) were reported as having
                epilepsy but did not fulfil the -study criteria. The progress of 59 of the 64 children with established epilepsy was reviewed again when they were aged 16. Of the 37 educated in normal schools eight (22%) had one or more seizures in their
                16th year compared with 13 out of 22 (59%) -who received special education. A possible cause for epilepsy was found in 17 of the 64 (27%) children, but for the majority there was no obvious reason. Key Messages x A cause of epilepsy was
                identified in only about a quarter of cases in the national child development study cohort x 35% of those diagnosed with epilepsy by age 16 no longer require drug treatment and are free from seizures by age 23 x 30% of young people in
                this cohort continued taking drugs for epilepsy for more than 2 years after their last seizure; 15 of these young people had not had a seizure for 6 or more years x Continuing epilepsy is more likely in those with neurological impairment
                or other additional medical conditions x After age 16 there is a high death rate in young people with epilepsy. This emphasizes the importance of maintaining supportive relationships between health care professionals and people with epilepsy
                as they become independent adults.
