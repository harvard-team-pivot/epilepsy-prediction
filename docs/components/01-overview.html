                <h3>What is epilepsy?</h3> Epilepsy is one of the most common neurologic conditions in the United States, affecting at least 1 in 100 adults and 1 in 20 children. There are more than 40 types of epilepsy—referred to collectively as the epilepsies—that cause recurrent
                seizures and that can be responsible for brain damage; neurological, cognitive, or psychiatric impairment; and death. Advances in research are improving our understanding of the scope of epilepsy and its public health impact.<br/> However,
                current approaches often do not fully take into account either the broad range of epilepsy disorders or their consequences for health and quality of life.[1] Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in childhood and can have a major
                impact on a child's development. In many children the seizures remit, but in others the disorder continues and may affect adult life.

                <h3>What are we trying to do?</h3> Our goal is to identify factors which may lead persons having seizures to be diagnosed with epilepsy. This will help medical personnel treat and prevent seizures at an early age. Several tests to diagnose epilepsy are performed to determine
                the cause of seizures. <br/> These tests may include:

        <div class="col-sm-10">
            <br/> However, the critical factors and threshold for diagnosis based on these tools is not hard-fast. As such, exploring various factors that might affect epilepsy and/or seizure recurrence could be useful for identifying the disease amongst
            the general population.<br/>

                <h3>Do demographics effect seizure occurence?</h3> Age specific incidence, cumulative incidence, and prevalence For the 19 children for whom the age at first seizure was not recorded, the onset of seizures was assigned to the midpoint of the age range in which it occurred. Annual incidence
                of the onset of seizures during the study averaged 0.35/1000 (range 0 to 14 new cases a year). Sixty two of the cohort members with epilepsy identified in this study had their first seizure before age 8 (early onset) and 82 before age
                12. Table 2 shows the age specific and cumulative incidence of onset of seizures. The prevalence of active epilepsy and age at follow up is shown in table 3. At age 7 prevalence is almost the same as the cumulative incidence (figure).
                By age 23 the cumulative incidence had more than doubled and prevalence increased by 60%. Because epilepsy is not necessarily persistent the prevalence of active epilepsy depends on the cumulative incidence and the definition of remission.
                The age specific incidence declined steadily (table 2) (P
                < 0.001, test for trend) but was slightly higher than the rate of remission, so the prevalence of active epilepsy rose gradually from 3.9/1000 at age 7 to 6.3/1000 at age 23 (figure).[3] <hr class="col-sm-12">

                <h3>Conclusion</h3> By the age of 11 years 1043 children (6-7%) in an unselected national sample had a history of seizures or other episodes of loss of consciousness; 322 (20 8/1000) had a history offebrile convulsions without other epileptic problems. A
                clear-cut diagnosis of non-febrile epilepsy was established in 64 children (41/1000) by the age of 11 on the basis of confirmatory information supplied by family doctors and paediatricians. A further 39 (2-6/1000) were reported as having
                epilepsy but did not fulfil the -study criteria. The progress of 59 of the 64 children with established epilepsy was reviewed again when they were aged 16. Of the 37 educated in normal schools eight (22%) had one or more seizures in their
                16th year compared with 13 out of 22 (59%) -who received special education. A possible cause for epilepsy was found in 17 of the 64 (27%) children, but for the majority there was no obvious reason. Key Messages x A cause of epilepsy was
                identified in only about a quarter of cases in the national child development study cohort x 35% of those diagnosed with epilepsy by age 16 no longer require drug treatment and are free from seizures by age 23 x 30% of young people in
                this cohort continued taking drugs for epilepsy for more than 2 years after their last seizure; 15 of these young people had not had a seizure for 6 or more years x Continuing epilepsy is more likely in those with neurological impairment
                or other additional medical conditions x After age 16 there is a high death rate in young people with epilepsy. This emphasizes the importance of maintaining supportive relationships between health care professionals and people with epilepsy
                as they become independent adults.
