        <h3>What is epilepsy?</h3>

        Determining the natural history of epilepsy in childhood poses
problems because doctors usually delay making the diagnosis
until the condition has established itself beyond reasonable
doubt. Deciding whether convulsions in young children are
due to febrile or non-febrile incidents can be very difficult even
with the benefit of hindsight. These problems bedevil the
accurate epidemiological study of children's epilepsy.
Many cross-sectional studies of children's epilepsy have been
carried out on a variety of samples drawn from medical or
educational sources, including community hospitals,l 2 general
practice,3-5 island communities,7 and cities.8 9 Others have
been directed to parents by door-to-door inquiries10 or through
the post.'1 From the United States two large cohort studies have
followed children with epilepsy up to 612 and 7 years of age.13
Cooper14 followed a much smaller British cohort, including 27
children with epilepsy, to the age of 15 years.
The need for more information about the long-term development
of children with epilepsy remains.'5 We review here the
histories of 64 young people in the National Child Development
Study -who were identified as having epilepsy during their first
11 years and discuss their seizure patterns, possible causation,
and progress up to the age of 16 and assess their condition in
relation to the many other types of seizure found in childhood.[1]

Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in
childhood1 and can have a major impact on a child's
development.2 3 In many children the seizures remit,4
but in others the disorder continues and may affect
adult life.5 Despite a large amount of published
literature from many countries on the incidence of epi­
lepsy in childhood,6 comparatively little is known about
the long term prospects for those who have epilepsy in
childhood.7 Review articles emphasise the difficulty of
comparing studies; variations in incidence rates may
not only reflect differences in occurrence but also
differences in case definition, diagnostic accuracy, and
study populations. Variations in prevalence may also
depend on the definition of active epilepsy.8 The
heterogeneous nature of seizure disorders causes addi­
tional complications: the term “epilepsy” is beginning
to be replaced by increasingly well defined epileptic
syndromes.9 Some people have associated disabilities
or additional health problems which influence the aeti­
ology, prognosis, prevention of seizures, and manage­
ment of the disease.[2]

        <h3>What are we trying to do?</h3>
        Incidences were calculated by using standard
survival methods.15 For the estimation of prevalence,
cohort members were considered to have active
epilepsy at a particular age if they were continuing to
take antiepilepsy drugs or had had at least one seizure
during the previous 2 years. Those who had not had a
seizure for more than 2 years and were not currently
receiving drug treatment for epilepsy were considered
to be in remission.

        <h3>Does demographics effect seizure occurance?</h3>
        Age specific incidence, cumulative incidence, and
prevalence
For the 19 children for whom the age at first seizure
was not recorded, the onset of seizures was assigned to
the midpoint of the age range in which it occurred.
Annual incidence of the onset of seizures during the
study averaged 0.35/1000 (range 0 to 14 new cases a
year). Sixty two of the cohort members with epilepsy
identified in this study had their first seizure before age
8 (early onset) and 82 before age 12. Table 2 shows the
age specific and cumulative incidence of onset of
seizures.
The prevalence of active epilepsy and age at follow
up is shown in table 3. At age 7 prevalence is almost the
same as the cumulative incidence (figure). By age 23
the cumulative incidence had more than doubled and
prevalence increased by 60%. Because epilepsy is not
necessarily persistent the prevalence of active epilepsy
depends on the cumulative incidence and the
definition of remission. The age specific incidence
declined steadily (table 2) (P < 0.001, test for trend) but
was slightly higher than the rate of remission, so the
prevalence of active epilepsy rose gradually from
3.9/1000 at age 7 to 6.3/1000 at age 23 (figure).[2]

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        Summary and conclusions
By the age of 11 years 1043 children (6-7%) in an unselected
national sample had a history of seizures or
other episodes of loss of consciousness; 322 (20 8/1000)
had a history offebrile convulsions without other epileptic
problems. A clear-cut diagnosis of non-febrile epilepsy
was established in 64 children (41/1000) by the age of 11
on the basis of confirmatory information supplied by
family doctors and paediatricians. A further 39 (2-6/1000)
were reported as having epilepsy but did not fulfil the
-study criteria. The progress of 59 of the 64 children
with established epilepsy was reviewed again when they
were aged 16. Of the 37 educated in normal schools eight
(22%) had one or more seizures in their 16th year
compared with 13 out of 22 (59%) -who received special
education.
A possible cause for epilepsy was found in 17 of the
64 (27%) children, but for the majority there was no
obvious reason.

Key Messages
x A cause of epilepsy was identified in only about a quarter of cases
in the national child development study cohort
x 35% of those diagnosed with epilepsy by age 16 no longer require
drug treatment and are free from seizures by age 23
x 30% of young people in this cohort continued taking drugs for
epilepsy for more than 2 years after their last seizure; 15 of these
young people had not had a seizure for 6 or more years
x Continuing epilepsy is more likely in those with neurological
impairment or other additional medical conditions
x After age 16 there is a high death rate in young people with
epilepsy. This emphasises the importance of maintaining
supportive relationships between health care professionals and
people with epilepsy as they become independent adults
