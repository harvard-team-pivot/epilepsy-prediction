                <h3>What is epilepsy?</h3> Epilepsy is one of the most common neurologic conditions in the United States, affecting at least 1 in 100 adults and 1 in 20 children. There are more than 40 types of epilepsy—referred to collectively as the epilepsies—that cause recurrent
                seizures and that can be responsible for brain damage; neurological, cognitive, or psychiatric impairment; and death. Advances in research are improving our understanding of the scope of epilepsy a nd its public health impact.<br/> However,
                current approaches often do not fully take into account either the broad range of epilepsy disorders or their consequences for health and quality of life.[1] Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in childhood and can have a major
                impact on a child's development. In many children the seizures remit, but in others the disorder continues and may affect adult life.

                <h3>What are we trying to do?</h3> Our goal is to identify factors which may lead persons having seizures to be diagnosed with epilepsy. This will help medical personnel treat and prevent seizures at an early age. Prompt medication can allow epilepsy patients to be cured
                of their seizures. This lower the burden on caregivers and the cost to society. Several tests to diagnose epilepsy are performed to determine the cause of seizures. <br/> These tests may include:

            <br/> However, the critical factors and threshold for diagnosis based on these tools is not hard-fast. As such, exploring various factors that might affect epilepsy and/or seizure recurrence could be useful for identifying the disease amongst
            the general population.<br/> We believe that classification can be achieved through additional, easier to obtain data points.

                <h3>What Data?</h3> The data we evaluated included:
                <ul class="list-group">
                    <li class="list-group-item">Efficacy results from clinical drug trials</li>

                <h3>Which factors are most important?</h3> After evaluating the relevance of all the variables in the data. We dropped columns because with large amount of predictors there could was high collinearity. That is, a great deal of the predictors were correlated, so only one of the group was kept. This allowed us to discard many of the columns. Subsequent calculations using a series of linear, quadratric, nearest-neighbor
                and tree based models established the following to be best across the most solutions:
                <ul class="list-group">
                    <li class="list-group-item">Convulsions or fits leading to unconsciousness</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Fit or convulsion in 1st year of life</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Abnormal heart</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Central nervous system condition</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Heart murmur</li>
                </ul>
                We suspect that these can be evaluated by health care professionals in areas where basic medical technology levels are available. This extends the usefulness of our model beyond the "First World."

                <h3>Conclusion</h3> Neurological examinations, where your doctor may test your behavior, motor
        abilities, mental function and other areas to diagnose your condition are a crucial first step in determining the type of epilepsy you may have.
        Corroborating the existing of the factors we have identified above allow a greater confidence in the diagnosis.
