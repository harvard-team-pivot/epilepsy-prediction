                <h3>Model Results</h3>
                Random forests provided the best classification for epilepsy.
                This method will give medical professionals another tool in their bag.
                Without this model, baseline costs would be around $16 billion
                next year.  By improving diagnosis accuracy 20% those costs can be
                reduced by $3 billion.  Getting patients into treatment sooner will
                increase life expectancy by seven years.  Finally the load on the
                understaffed US healthcare industry can be shifted to higher yield
                strategies.

                <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                Continuous exploration brought up new questions. It's the iterative nature of the process.
                <br/>Can we do better clustering?
                <br/>Should we have split rows by [seizures, epilepsy, neither]
                <br/>Did we miss a grouping and influence our results by including all the seizure categories
                 instead of further separating these values?
                 <br/>Could we have built a model
                 that predicts people who have seizures but are not diagnosed with epilepsy?
                <br/>Could we have better combined our datasources?  There were more NCDS cohorts available.
                <br/>Time series analyses may have allowed us to further tune our models.
