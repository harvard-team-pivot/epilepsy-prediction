                <h3>Model</h3> Age specific incidence, cumulative incidence, and prevalence For the 19 children for whom the age at first seizure was not recorded, the onset of seizures was assigned to the midpoint of the age range in which it occurred. Annual incidence
                of the onset of seizures during the study averaged 0.35/1000 (range 0 to 14 new cases a year). Sixty two of the cohort members with epilepsy identified in this study had their first seizure before age 8 (early onset) and 82 before age
                12. Table 2 shows the age specific and cumulative incidence of onset of seizures. The prevalence of active epilepsy and age at follow up is shown in table 3. At age 7 prevalence is almost the same as the cumulative incidence (figure).
                By age 23 the cumulative incidence had more than doubled and prevalence increased by 60%. Because epilepsy is not necessarily persistent the prevalence of active epilepsy depends on the cumulative incidence and the definition of remission.
                The age specific incidence declined steadily (table 2) (P
                < 0.001, test for trend) but was slightly higher than the rate of remission, so the prevalence of active epilepsy rose gradually from 3.9/1000 at age 7 to 6.3/1000 at age 23 (figure).[3] <hr class="col-sm-12">
