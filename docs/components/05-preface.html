        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        Determining the natural history of epilepsy in childhood poses
        problems because doctors usually delay making the diagnosis
        until the condition has established itself beyond reasonable
        doubt. Deciding whether convulsions in young children are
        due to febrile or non-febrile incidents can be very difficult even
        with the benefit of hindsight. These problems bedevil the
        accurate epidemiological study of children's epilepsy.
        Many cross-sectional studies of children's epilepsy have been
        carried out on a variety of samples drawn from medical or
        educational sources, including community hospitals,l 2 general
        practice,3-5 island communities,7 and cities.8 9 Others have
        been directed to parents by door-to-door inquiries10 or through
        the post.'1 From the United States two large cohort studies have
        followed children with epilepsy up to 612 and 7 years of age.13
        Cooper14 followed a much smaller British cohort, including 27
        children with epilepsy, to the age of 15 years.
        The need for more information about the long-term development
        of children with epilepsy remains.'5 We review here the
        histories of 64 young people in the National Child Development
        Study -who were identified as having epilepsy during their first
        11 years and discuss their seizure patterns, possible causation,
        and progress up to the age of 16 and assess their condition in
        relation to the many other types of seizure found in childhood.[2]

        Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in
        childhood1 and can have a major impact on a child's
        development.2 3 In many children the seizures remit,4
        but in others the disorder continues and may affect
        adult life.5 Despite a large amount of published
        literature from many countries on the incidence of epi­
        lepsy in childhood,6 comparatively little is known about
        the long term prospects for those who have epilepsy in
        childhood.7 Review articles emphasise the difficulty of
        comparing studies; variations in incidence rates may
        not only reflect differences in occurrence but also
        differences in case definition, diagnostic accuracy, and
        study populations. Variations in prevalence may also
        depend on the definition of active epilepsy.8 The
        heterogeneous nature of seizure disorders causes addi­
        tional complications: the term “epilepsy” is beginning
        to be replaced by increasingly well defined epileptic
        syndromes.9 Some people have associated disabilities
        or additional health problems which influence the aeti­
        ology, prognosis, prevention of seizures, and manage­
        ment of the disease.[2]

        <h3>Project Objectives</h3>

        Review the histories of participants in the various studies. Identify
        and classify their seizure patterns. Build a model that can help
        health care professionals assess new patients conditions in relation
        to the many other types of seizure found in childhood. An accurate
        judgement on whether one of the epilepsy syndromes is present will allow
        appropriate treatment to begin before long-term damage happens.
        <br/>Follow a known good data science process.
