            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            Determining the natural history of epilepsy in childhood poses problems because doctors usually delay making the diagnosis until the condition has established itself beyond reasonable doubt. Deciding whether convulsions in young children
            are due to febrile (triggered by a fever) or non-febrile incidents can be very difficult even with the benefit of hindsight. These problems bedevil the accurate epidemiological study of children's epilepsy. Many cross-sectional studies of
            children's epilepsy have been carried out on a variety of samples drawn from medical or educational sources, including community hospitals, general practitioners and cities.From the United States two large cohort studies have followed children
            with epilepsy up to 7 years of age. This followed a much smaller British cohort, including 27 children with epilepsy, to the age of 15 years. The need for more information about the long-term development of children with epilepsy remains.
            We review here the histories of the young people in the National Child Development Study -who were identified as having epilepsy during their first 11 years and model their seizure patterns, possible causation, and progress up to the age of
            16 and assess their condition in relation to the many other types of seizure found in childhood.[2]
            <br/> Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in childhood and can have a major impact on a child's development.2In many children the seizures remit, but in others the disorder continues and may affect adult life. Despite a large amount
            of published literature from many countries on the incidence of epilepsy in childhood, comparatively little is known about the long term prospects for those who have epilepsy in childhood. There is considerable difficulty in comparing studies;
            variations in incidence rates may not only reflect differences in occurrence but also differences in case definition, diagnostic accuracy, and study populations. Variations in prevalence may also depend on the definition of active epilepsy.
            The heterogeneous nature of seizure disorders causes addi­tional complications: the term “epilepsy” is being replaced by increasingly well defined epileptic syndromes. Some people have associated disabilities or additional health problems
            which influence the aeti­ology, prognosis, prevention of seizures, and manage­ment of the disease.[2]

            An accurate judgement on whether one of the epilepsy syndromes is present will allow appropriate treatment to begin before long-term damage happens.

            <h3>Research and Tools</h3>
            Our website was built with <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a>.
            It was based on Twitter <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> templates.
            Hosting is on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.
            Pair programming and source control were facilitated by <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>,
            <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> and <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>.
            Python and the <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> notebook were our primary tools for data exploration and cleaning.
            The <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a> machine learning library was utilized for
            dimensionality reduction, classification, clustering and model selection.
            Our primary dataset was obtained through a joint program between
            <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/">Harvard</a>
            and the <a href="https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/">UK Data Service</a>.
            All requisite privacy requirements were observed.

            Preliminary data sets were suggested by the CS109A teaching staff.
            The graphical <a href="http://nesstar.esds.ac.uk/">Nesstar</a> tool
            allowed us to explore dataset variables and metadata.  This was
            invaluable in helping us select the appropriate series
