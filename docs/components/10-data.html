        Summary of Data Source 1: The Association Between Childhood Seizures and Later Childhood Emotional and Behavioral Problems: Findings From a Nationally Representative Birth Cohort

        This study explores the social disadvantages of children afflicted with epilepsy.  Primarily the study focuses on understanding the linkages between: 1.) perinatal complications with seizures and emotional/behavioral disorders, 2.) the association of seizure disorders with emotional/behavioral disorders, 3.) social disadvantage and fetal risk indicators as risk factors for seizures and emotional/behavioral disorders

        This study found suggestions from the data that social disadvantage and a history of fetal vulnerability should not be a barrier to accessing care in children with mental health problems.
